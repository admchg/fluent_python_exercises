Chapter 13 Problem Set

In this problem set we will practice operator overloading by implementing two classes: ClockFaceTime and ClockFaceTimeDelta.

ClockFaceTime should emulate a 12-hour analog clock (think the old-fashioned kind with the hands) defined as a tuple of (Hour, Minute, Second).

ClockFaceTimeDelta should enable us to add or subtract time from ClockFaceTime. Define ClockFaceTimeDelta as a tuple of (Hour, Minute, Second).

In addition to implementing addition and subtraction methods so that we can manipulate ClockFaceTime using ClockFaceTimeDelta, think carefully through the operator types covered in the chapter (unary, infix, rich comparison, augmented assignment) and implement those you find appropriate.
